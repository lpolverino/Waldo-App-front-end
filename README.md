# Waldo-App-front-end
Here is the FrontEnd of my phototapping Waldo app, it fetches the data from the backend presents the differents levels to play, and displays the gamaboard and scores for every level.
It was developed in ReactJs and was a cool project with many difficulties, how to get the real position of the mouse respective to the image displayed size was the most interesting one. 

## Install
Simply clone the project and type in your terminal "npm run dev". 

## Usage
If you know react, you can basically do anything you want. In the enviroment.js file is a function to retrieve the backend URl that is generally passed by context from the top levels of the routes. You can modify to use any API that you want or check the one i developed in Express [right here](https://github.com/lpolverino/Waldo-backend).
